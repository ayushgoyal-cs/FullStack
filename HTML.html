            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
            cues for the appearance of the document.
